# VSWorlde

VSWorlde is a small, local, terminal-based word-guessing game inspired by modern word puzzles.

Features
- Guess a 5-letter word in up to 6 attempts.
- Emoji feedback: 🟩 correct position, 🟨 present elsewhere, ⬛ absent.

How to run

```bash
python3 VSWorlde.py
```

Run internal self-tests:

```bash
python3 VSWorlde.py --selftest
```

Notes
- This project is inspired by popular word-guessing games but does not reproduce any proprietary assets or word lists.
- If you want a GUI or web version, I can scaffold a simple web UI next.
